**TL;DR:** Files v3.4 adds support for filtering file names, remapping keyboard shortcuts, custom background images, an integration with Listary, and more. Continue reading to learn more about these changes.

## What's new in v3.4

### Filter file names

We added a new filtering feature that allows users to quickly find files by name. Entering a query in the search bar will filter the results in real-time within the current directory, displaying only the files that match the query. This feature is particularly useful for users who deal with a large number of files and need to locate specific items without starting a full search.

### Remap keyboard shortcuts

We added a new settings page for Actions allowing you to customize keyboard shortcuts. This feature allows you to assign shortcuts to any action and also provides the option to remap existing key bindings, tailoring your keyboard layout to fit your workflow.

### Personalize Files with a custom background image

We added a new theming feature that lets you customize Files with your own background image. To set it up, navigate to Settings > Appearance, find the "Background Image" section, and hit "Browse". Select an image that resonates with you, and watch as Files transforms it into a stunning backdrop, infusing your workspace with a unique flair. For an even more tailored experience, you have the option to fine-tune the imageâ€™s opacity and adjust the display settings to your liking.

### Added an integration with Listary

We're excited to announce a new integration with Listary - a powerful search utility renowned for its rapid retrieval of files and folders. You can activate this powerful integration directly from the Integrations page in Listaryâ€™s settings. Elevate your productivity with these cutting-edge enhancements:

**Instant search results**: A double tap of the `ctrl` key brings up the search bar, delivering immediate access to your files.

**Contextual power**: Engage with Listaryâ€™s rich context menu by right-clicking any search result, unlocking a vast array of actions right where you need them.

**Folder navigate**: Discover the ease of navigating to folders; a single click on any folder in the search results instantly opens it in the current tab or pane of Files.
